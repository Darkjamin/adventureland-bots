# Optimizing Attack 2

This will be the second video I make about Adventure Land.

## YouTube

You will be able to watch the video on YouTube when I finish making it. I will update this README with the link after I finish making, and uploading the video.

## Scripts

### 1_base.js

This has the logic for moving, healing, and looting. We load this code in every script to reduce the amount of variables.

### 2_default.js

This script is the baseline if you run the `6_reduce_cooldown.js` code from the previous video on three characters.
