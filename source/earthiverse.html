You might be able to run your bots with my bots depending on how many are currently running.
Note that if my bots stop or crash for whatever reason, your bots will stop, too.
Your bots may also not do what you want.
Lock and/or seal any important items, mail them to yourself, or put them on a character that you won't ever run using this service.

If you need help, or have any questions, message me on Discord (earthiverse#9832)

1. Load the function:

    async function startEarthiverseCharacter(name, url = 'https://monsterhunt.earthiverse.ca/') {
        if(!parent.X) throw new Error("Couldn't find `X` data!")
        if(!parent.user_id) throw new Error("Couldn't find `parent.user_id`!")
        if(!parent.user_auth) throw new Error("Couldn't find `parent.user_auth`!")
        
        const xData = parent.X.characters.find(x => x.name == name)
        if(!xData) throw new Error(`Couldn't find a character with the name ${name}!`)
        if(xData.online) throw new Error(`It looks like ${name} is already online!`)
        
        return fetch(url, {
            "credentials": "omit",
            "headers": {
                ntent-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
            },
            "referrer": url,
            "body": new URLSearchParams({
                "user": parent.user_id,
                "auth": parent.user_auth,
                "char": xData.id,
                "char_type": xData.type
            }),
            "method": "POST",
            "mode": "no-cors"
        })
    }
