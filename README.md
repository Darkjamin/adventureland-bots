# Adventure.land Bots

This is the code I use to run my bots in [AdventureLand](https://adventure.land). I use an NPM package I also made called [ALClient](https://github.com/earthiverse/alclient).

Take a look, feel free to modify it to suit your own needs, or for inspiration.

If you want to contribute to [ALClient](https://github.com/earthiverse/alclient) development, please do!

There's also a folder called `vanilla_scripts`. Those scripts are meant to be run in the main game, do not attempt to run them with ALClient.
